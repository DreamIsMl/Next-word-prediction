# Bangla Next Word Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building a next-word prediction model for the Bengali (Bangla) language. The model has been trained on English text data, with translation mechanisms incorporated into the training process. The aim is to predict the next word in a Bangla sentence given a context, enabling applications like text completion and suggestion.

## Dataset

The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of English text, and translation mechanisms have been applied to adapt the model for Bangla language prediction. The training dataset is available in the `data` directory.
